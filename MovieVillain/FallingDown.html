  <h1><center>William Foster — <i>Falling Down</i> (1993)</center></h1>
  <p><b><u>WARNING:</b></u> The following analysis contains <b><u>SPOILERS!</b></u> I strongly suggest first watching the complete film for your own entertainment and interpretation.</p>
  <p>Falling Down (1993) still resonates with me as one of the most original, thought-provoking, and quite honestly, funny films I’ve ever watched. I’ve always claimed that usually, some of my most favorite films are the ones that feature an interesting character who causes me to think critically, and examine my values. Similarly, I will always enjoy a film which can make me repeatedly laugh, while not being a part of the comedy genre. Falling Down is a perfect blend of these two concepts in my opinion, and it’s also one entry in a rare assortment of films featuring a villain as the protagonist of the story. As a fan of Michael Douglas in general, particularly from movies such as Wall Street (1987), The War of the Roses (1989), The Game (1997), Wonder Boys (2000), and Solitary Man (2009), I was intrigued by the film’s tag line — “The adventures of an ordinary man at war with the everyday world.”, and decided to check it out. The film follows Douglas’ character, William Foster (otherwise known as Bill Foster, or simply ‘D-Fens’) as he journeys through the city of Los Angeles, on foot, so that he may arrive home in time for his daughter’s birthday party. </p>

  <p>We learn almost right from the beginning, that Foster’s not legally allowed to see his daughter, or his ex-wife, and yet he’s obsessed with this simple notion of coming home. He embarks on this journey across the densely populated city after abandoning his car during a traffic jam in the opening scene, and encounters many people who “get in his way” which throughout the film, is a concept which becomes somewhat blurred with disagreeing with him. He trashes a local convenient store after he attempts to purchase a cold beverage because he believes the prices are inflated. He de-commissions a phone booth by shooting it with a submachine gun (acquired from an earlier encounter with local gang members), after somebody shouts at him for taking too long. He holds up a fast food restaurant at gun point, after being denied breakfast food during lunch period. He even goes as far as destroying a road repair site, after arguing with a lazy construction worker that he knows the department constantly performs unnecessary repairs in order to justify their inflated budget, claiming “I’ll give you something to fix”. Amidst the havoc that Foster wreaks on Los Angeles, local police officer (played by Robert Duvall) attempts to track him down, and discovers that Foster had worked as an engineer for a defense plant, before being laid-off a month prior to the events of the film.</p>

  <p>The film serves as a riveting commentary on American society, using Foster to exemplify the struggles and thoughts of the working, middle-class, white American man at the time of the 1990‘s economic recession. He feels cheated, and wants to live the life he believes that he’s earned — an employed husband and father who symbolizes the prosperity of America (at least, in an earlier time period). The weight of Foster’s feelings and confusion are conveyed quite powerfully at the climax of the film when he’s about to be apprehended by Duvall’s character. Emotionally, he delivers one of the film’s most memorable lines. </p>

  <p>Foster’s such an interesting character, and some may find it incorrect to label him as a villain. While I would certainly agree he’s on the lower end of the spectrum regarding obviousness, William Foster is still, nonetheless, a movie villain. In almost any definition of villain you encounter, the most common theme stands that a villain harnesses or exacts some sort of evil desire, or motivation. Without delving into too much philosophy, evil arises from and concerns immorality, or the lack of conformity to certain principles which distinguish between good and bad behavior. In this sense, Foster is clearly a villain because essentially the entire plot emerges from his various clashes with members of society, often concluding with an absurd reaction on his part, violating commonly accepted standards of behavior.  </p>

  <p>William Foster remains one of the most memorable, humanized movie villains, because he represents the end of a pre-existing generation of American citizens and societal values — the hardworking, loyal husband and father with patriotic beliefs was the ideal American; if you wake up in the morning and go to work, you’re guaranteed to live happily, and have financial security. Sadly, that’s no longer the case for Foster’s generation throughout the 1990's, and his actions/rants throughout the film offer one final bang to the system before he’s reduced to a mere relic of a bygone era, who’s worth can now only be measured by the amount of life insurance money granted to his daughter upon his death. Viewers understand the wrongness of Foster’s actions, yet are challenged to deduce from where exactly that feeling of entitlement originated. The sagacious viewer will see that although he severely oversteps his boundaries in the film, there were many William Fosters in the world at the time of Falling Down’s release, and his frustrations still exist with many Americans in a variety of different forms throughout our modern society. </p>
