    <center><p>There are many different definitions you will encounter, of course. Yet, the common theme of evil or immorality always exists within our understanding of a villain.</p></center>
    <p>When posed with that question, a lot of people will say that the villain is the antagonist of the story. That’s not necessarily true. The “bad guy” doesn’t have to be the antagonist, just like the “good guy” doesn’t have to be the protagonist. The antagonist is simply the adversary of the protagonist - the character that opposes the protagonist. The protagonist, on the other hand is the character that drives the story, the character that the audience follows. There’s nothing inherently good or bad about either one; it’s just a matter of who we follow, and who gets in the way of that person’s goal or desire. There are plenty of excellent films which feature villains as protagonists. I’m talking about movies like Taxi Driver (1976), A Clockwork Orange (1971), or even more modern films such as American Psycho (2000), There Will Be Blood (2007), or Nightcrawler (2014). There have also been many successful television dramas which adopt this style, such as The Sopranos (1999 - 2007), Breaking Bad (2008 - 2013), or House of Cards (2013—).</p>
    <center><p>Now that we understand what a villain is, and the different variations they may take, I’ll ask the million dollar question. Why do we like them? Why are they so memorable? </p></center>

    <p>Plain and simple, this is my honest opinion. Typically, a viewer will resonate the most with a villain when the villain is humanized or makes relatable choices. If you understand the motive behind the actions of a villain, and you can find human traits within that character, no matter how evil they may be, they’re going to stick with you. It’s mainly a matter of the writing. Again, right now I’m talking about film specifically, but really I believe this principle holds true throughout any form of storytelling. Of course, there are plenty of other reasons that viewers will love movie villains — some of which are the most seemingly inhuman, actually (The Terminator, Freddy Krueger, Agent Smith, Anton Chigurh, Michael Myers...etc.). However, I’m proposing a theory that I believe holds true, but has become overlooked; I want to help you understand why you love those particular movie villains who you don’t know why you love. Now, if you’re not 100% sure what I mean by this, I’m gonna give you some examples. And no I’m not going to use The Joker from The Dark Knight. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a fantastic villain and definitely one of the most interesting, but there’s hardly any ground left to plow on that field. If you want to hear about The Joker, there’s plenty of other analysis videos and articles out there. Anyway, Here we go. Enjoy! </p>
