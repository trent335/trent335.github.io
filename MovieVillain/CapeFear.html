  <h1><center>Max Cady — <i>Cape Fear</i> (1991)</center></h1>
  <p><b><u>WARNING:</b></u> The following analysis contains <b><u>SPOILERS!</b></u> I strongly suggest first watching the complete film for your own entertainment and interpretation.</p>

  <p>Martin Scorsese’s Cape Fear will always remain one of my absolute favorites. I’ll never forget being completely glued to the screen when I first watched it; Max Cady is a villain unlike any other. Robert De Niro is absolutely menacing in this film, and it’s truly one of the greatest performances by an actor that I’ve ever seen, hands down. </p>

  <p>Max Cady is a serial rapist. And serial is not an exaggeration. Throughout the story, there are references to three separate instances of rape in Cady’s past — The incident which landed him in prison in the first place, and the two other instances which Bowden briefly mentions in the final scene. There’s one instance of rape which we as the audience witness — Laurie. And there’s two other characters who he’s clearly planning on raping — Lee and Danny. And this is just what we learn during the course of the story; there’s probably a lot more, which we just don’t hear about! Now before you start making assumptions about where I’m heading with this, let me just clarify — The film makes absolutely no attempt to defend his motivations. Nobody in the right mind will say that you can sympathize with this character in terms of why he chooses to rape women. But this is one of the reasons why the film is so unique, because it’s not about the controversy of rape, it’s about the controversy of criminal justice.</p>

  <p>In the film, Sam Bowden, played by Nick Nolte, is a lawyer who’s being repeatedly stalked, threatened, and harassed by Max Cady; Cady has just been released from a 14 year prison sentence. We learn very early on in the story, that Bowden was actually Cady’s state appointed defense lawyer for the rape trial 14 years ago. In his research for Cady’s defense, Bowden discovered a piece of evidence which suggested that the victim was promiscuous. Knowing what kind of person Cady was, and knowing that that report could have potentially swayed the jury into acquitting Cady, Bowden suppressed the evidence, and buried the report — which is extremely illegal, if you’re unaware. He didn’t defend his client to the best of his ability, which violates Cady’s right as a citizen to have a fair trial. But during his prison sentence, Cady discovered this report, and learned of Bowden’s secret misconduct. This sets him on a path of vengeance because he blames Bowden for being locked away in the first place. There is no question as to whether or not Max Cady is a foul human being. He’s deranged, and he’s psychopathic. But here’s my point, and the point that I feel the film attempts to convey. He’s still a human being. And don’t all human beings deserve equal protection under the law? Isn’t everybody supposed to have the right to a fair trial, no matter what they did that landed them in that situation? These themes are perfectly expressed in the exciting climax of the film, which takes place on a boat along the Cape Fear river, during a storm. Cady’s on a violent rampage, tormenting Bowden and his family, and forcing him to own his mistake.</p>

  <font size = "5"><p><center><i>“You were my <b>lawyer!</b> You were my lawyer! That report could have saved me <b>fourteen</b> years!”</i></center> </p></font>
  <p>This scene showcases one of the most powerful and meaningful exchanges of the film, which really fuels the message pretty well. “You were a menace.” “You were my lawyer!!” In our society, we don’t get to take the law into our own hands, we have a criminal justice system. Max Cady’s furiously stating that it doesn’t matter whether or not I’m a menace. What gives you the right to decide my fate? De Niro is so immersed into the character at this point in the film, that it’s hard to imagine him as the overprotective father in the Meet the Parents trilogy, or the soon-to-be Mafia boss, in The Godfather Part II. I’ve always said that when you watch Cape Fear, you completely forget that this is an actor. You’re not watching De Niro, you’re watching Max Cady.</p>

  <font size = "5"><p><center><i>“A lawyer... should represent his client...”</i></center> </p></font>

  <font size = "5"><p><center><i>“Should zealously represent his client within the bounds of the law! And I find you guilty, Counselor. Guilty of betraying your fellow man, guilty of betraying your country, guilty of abrogating your oath, guilty of judging me and selling me out!”</i></center> </p></font>
  <p>It’s one thing to accept a punishment if you’re found guilty under a fair and balanced trial, but it’s another thing to learn that you didn’t receive a fair trial, and that you had a pretty good chance of being found not guilty had you not been deliberately denied that essential human right. This takes on a whole new meaning, when that punishment equals 14 years of your life. In that sense, while we don’t condone Cady’s actions, and we hopefully don’t like him as a person, we sympathize with the discrimination he’s endured. Even such a savagely inhumane character, becomes strikingly human and we understand why he seeks revenge. </p>
  <p>Now again, don’t misinterpret what I’m saying. The manner in which he chooses exacts his revenge is an entirely separate subject than his discrimination and motivations. Just because you’ve been wronged doesn’t mean you can stalk, harass, rape or kill people. But it’s important to analyze why he feels he’s been wronged because that brings out the human elements within his character, and ultimately translates to the themes of morality and justice that the film explores. And this goes back to what I was saying in the beginning. The fact that Cady’s essentially established as a monster from the very beginning, better serves the theme of the film. It’s easier to relate to a character you like, or somebody who seems to have a defense for their actions. Max Cady does not have an explanation for why he rapes women. He does not have a motive. He presumably does it for mere enjoyment. This movie challenges you to sympathize even just the slightest bit with such a brutal, seemingly inhuman character, and ultimately, if you’re a critical viewer, I think it succeeds in that effort, even if you’re not immediately aware that you felt that way.</p>
  <p>On one last note, I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. This is one of the very few remakes out there that I feel is genuinely better than the original film, which, in this case was from 1962 starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum. </p>
  <center><img src="CapeFearOld.jpg"></center>
  <p>And the reason I consider the remake superior is because the changes that are made to the story in the remake, drastically alter and expand the themes that the film explores. The character analysis that I just discussed for De Niro’s version of Max Cady, doesn’t really work for Mitchum’s portrayal of the same character in the 1962 adaptation, and that’s one of the main reasons I’ve always enjoyed the remake much more. Though I strongly encourage you to watch both versions and make the decision for yourself. Both versions are adapted from a 1957 novel by John MacDonald titled “The Executioners”. While each film takes their own liberties from the book, the remake is substantially different, and like I mentioned, I think overall much better because of these story changes. In summary, practically everything that I just discussed, is a result of storytelling, and character creation. The humanity of the villains, or characters, always flourish as a result of the writing. The writing may be from a screenplay. It may be from a book of which the film is an adaptation. It could even be the re-writing of dialogue by an actor. All in all, the best movie villains are the ones which are the most humanized, and make the most relatable choices, and this is mainly a result of writing.
