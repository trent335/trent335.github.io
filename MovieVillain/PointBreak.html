  <h1><center>Bodhi — <i>Point Break</i> (1991)</center></h1>
  <center><p><b><u>WARNING:</b></u> The following analysis contains <b><u>SPOILERS!</b></u> I strongly suggest first watching the complete film for your own entertainment and interpretation.</p></center>
  <p>Point Break (1991) certainly remains an exciting, thrilling entry in the action film genre, but also subtly serves as an honest examination of human relationships — the line which distinguishes between friend and enemy is not as clear as one might imagine. This film has garnered quite a cult following over the years, and even spawned a 2015 remake, which was largely inferior to the original. This movie features one of the most underrated performances by Patrick Swayze in his portrayal of our villain, Bodhi. Most people cite Dirty Dancing (1987), Road House (1989), or Ghost (1990) as Swayze’s career-defining characters, but I find it difficult to compete with Bodhi from Point Break. </p>
  <p>Point Break follows the pursuits of rookie FBI Agent Johnny Utah, played by Keanu Reeves in one of his earliest roles, as he works to apprehend a group of notorious bank-robbers known as “The Ex-Presidents” (appropriately named after their Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jimmy Carter disguises worn throughout the heists).</p>

  <p>They never harm anybody, and they never rob from the vault — they only take what they need from the drawers. Utah’s parter, Angelo Pappas (played by Gary Busey), has theorized that The Ex-Presidents are actually a group of surfers; Utah then goes undercover, infiltrating the surfing community in order to pursue this notion. As he works undercover, Utah gradually develops a sense of belonging and identity with this beachside community, experiencing the thrill of surfing, pursuing a love interest, and bonding with a friendly group of local surfers, led by our man named Bodhi.</p>

  <p>Utah effectively becomes somewhat of a fifth member to this group and he forms a brotherly connection with Bodhi. After being immersed alongside Utah into this beautiful world, we learn that Bodhi and our beloved surfer gang, are actually The Ex-Presidents, who rob banks in order to fund their lifestyle, which in turn allows them to exemplify their philosophical beliefs dictating how people should properly exist. On the beach, Bodhi delivers a moving speech to the rest of The Ex-Presidents, which provides intriguing human qualities to his character.</p>

  <font size = "5"><p><center><i>“This was never about money for us. It was about us against the system... that system that kills the human spirit. We stand for something, to those dead souls inching along the freeways in their metal coffins. We show them... that the human spirit is still alive.”</i></center> </p></font>
  <p>At this point in the story, we understand that Bodhi is not a typical movie villain with evil desires, but rather somewhat of an philosophical activist, taking a stand alongside his friends as a means of protesting modern society, which he believes severely lacks essential elements of the human condition. He hates violence, and he only robs banks in order to secure the money needed to continue his lifestyle of harmless adrenaline. Prior to Utah’s newfound friendship with Bodhi and the gang, there were clearly defined parameters regarding how an audience should view the characters. The Ex-Presidents are clearly bad people because they’re committing crimes — they are the enemy of FBI Agent Utah, the good person. These distinctions become distorted and muddied as the film progresses. Utah deduces the identity of The Ex-Presidents about halfway through the film, and our surfers similarly discover his true profession shortly afterwards. However, the official “un-masking” doesn’t take place until the film is about to enter its forth quarter. Some of the most memorable sequences, particularly the infamous sky-diving scene, showcase the emotional bond of these friends, despite both parties knowing the true identity of the other, and that their friendship will inevitably end at some point soon. </p>
  <p>As one would unfortunately expect, once Utah and Bodhi reveal their identities to one another, chaos ensues. The Ex-Presidents force Utah to aid them in their final bank heist for the season, by threatening to harm Tyler, Utah’s love interest. Bodhi is visibly flustered and uneasy about having to resort to such measures, as he’s never wanted to harm anybody, but simultaneously does not want to spend the rest of his life in prison. The heist goes wrong, and in the ensuing pursuit, all of The Ex-Presidents are killed except for Bodhi, who ultimately escapes. </p>
  <p>In one of the best, and most exhilarating epilogues to any film I’ve scene, Utah tracks down Bodhi nine months later, on the shores of Bells Beach, Australia in the middle of what is known as “The 50-Year Storm” (an event alluded to earlier in the film by Bodhi who has always dreamed of surfing the largest waves produced by this weather system — the largest in the world). After some dialogue and a physical altercation, Utah handcuffs Bodhi to himself, and signals the FBI helicopter that Bodhi’s ready to be captured. Point Break challenges viewers to sympathize with Bodhi, who has unfortunately become a much greater villain by this point, than he was at the beginning of the story. Not only is he the leader of a team of serial bank robbers, but his actions have now led to multiple deaths and injuries, most of which were his own friends. In this moment as he looks at the enormous waves, Bodhi delivers his heartfelt speech which further humanizes such a fascinating movie villain. </p>

  <font size = "5"><p><center><i>“OK, man. OK... I’m screwed. I’m gonna go to jail and I’ll pay, and Johnny Utah gets his guy. Right? Good for you. That’s real good. You’re gonna be a big hero now. But look at it, Johnny. Look at it! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, man... Just let me go out there, let me get one wave before you take me. One wave. I mean, where am I gonna go, man? Cliffs on both sides, I’m not gonna paddle to New Zealand! My whole life has been about this moment, Johnny. Come on, compadre...”</i></center> </p></font>
  <p>In these final moments of the film as Bodhi begs to be unlocked from the handcuffs, Utah understands what he’s truly asking. The waves are so dangerous that Bodhi knows he won’t return from the ocean if he attempts to surf. He’d rather die surfing than spend the rest of his life behind bars. This is a very universal theme that the film beautiful incorporates into the conclusion, that adds to Bodhi’s profoundly human qualities. Think about elderly people who refuse to move into a retirement home, or people with severe illnesses who opt not to seek treatment. Why prolong life, if you know the quality of your living will severely diminish? Bodhi’s powerful speech and the resulting contemplation by Utah resonate with viewers because it highlights the friendship that still remains between these two characters, despite the tragedies that have occurred as a result of their acquaintance with one another. The audience relates to Bodhi the most during these final moments because he symbolizes the black sheep, that person in our lives who thinks differently but means well. He personifies that feeling we encounter when we try to explain to somebody, “You just don’t know them, like I do.” Bodhi meant well, but he made some mistakes; Utah knows Bodhi isn’t really a bad person at heart, and never has been. Therefore, he makes the decision to release his friend, allowing him to die with dignity, doing what he loves.</p>

  <p>Bodhi remains one of the most humanized movie villains because at the conclusion of the film, the good guy has prevailed and the bad guy has been defeated. However, despite this seemingly positive outcome, the mood of the film and reaction of the viewers at the end remains somber, as though we’ve just lost a loved one. Bodhi wasn’t merely the villain in Point Break — he was also our friend.</p>
