  <h1><center><i>Why have you made this website?</i></center></h1>
  <p>I believe that most great characters, are first and foremost a product of great storytelling. Film, television, theater, novels... it almost always begins with the writing. It’s about the story and the way the story is told. No matter how captivating or skilled an actor may be, viewers will likely find it difficult to immerse themselves into a movie if the story is weak. At the very least, the audience will be too disengaged with the story to care about the character as much as they potentially could have. This is not uncommon. Think about it. Have you ever watched movie with a top notch actor or actress, and the movie disappointed you? Or even worse: you have a favorite movie character, right? You get excited and you research other movies with that same actor or actress. Sound familiar? However, did you find that you really didn’t like a lot of those other movies after you watched them? There’s no exact formula for this, but chances are, the scripts or the overall stories were probably not as strong as the first movie you watched. The character’s weren’t well developed. The theme wasn’t clear. The dialogue was unnatural, or any other number of issues related to writing.</p>
  <p>Now, don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that the writing’s all that matters. Filmmaking is a collaborate effort in every aspect... screenwriting, acting, directing, cinematography, editing, etc. However, I would argue that in most cases, writing plays the most significant role in whether or not any character will resonate with an audience. I know this is all pretty subjective, but I’m not claiming any hard-core facts. I’m just trying to get you to think. Think about your favorite movie characters. Think about why you might love them so much. Did you have an emotional attachment to the character? Did you put yourself in their shoes? Did you become sad or angry when something happened to that character, or after that character made a certain choice? Were you finding the character unpredictable, did that interest you more? Or were they very predictable, an in turn, relatable? Did that character’s choices make you appreciate the theme of the story? Or did it lead you to the discovery of that theme? As you ask yourself these questions, I think you’ll find there’s a lot of credit that needs to be given to storytellers. It’s not easy to create a character, or a story that survives the test of time. As you explore my website, keep these thoughts in your mind, and make your own decision! </p>
    <h1><center><i>What are your favorite movies?</i></center></h1>
  <p>Though my list naturally changes over time, most of these titles remain consistent in my list of all-time favorites. In order to make this list, I have to answer the following question: “Can I watch this movie any time, of any day, no matter what mood I’m in?" They are organized by date, not by preference. </p>
<center><p>&bull;Twelve Angry Men (1957)</p>
<p>&bull; Paths of Glory (1957)</p>
<p>&bull; The Rocky Franchise (1976—)</p>
<p>&bull; Halloween (1978)</p>

<p>&bull; Sleep Tight (2011)</p>
<p>&bull; Nightcrawler (2014)</p>
<p>&bull; The Revenant (2016)</p></center>

<p>It’s also think it’s important to compile a list of close runner-ups. I can’t consider a film one of my favorites, unless I’ve watched it at least several times. Some of these may soon end up on my favorites list, provided that I still love them after I’ve seen them a couple more times, verifying their re-watch-ability. </p>
